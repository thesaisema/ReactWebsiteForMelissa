                 Melissa, you are such a beautiful being inside and out. You are so thoughtful, caring, and protective of the people that you love.
                 You are a daughter of God. I am so grateful that the Lord himself has made you my sister in this life (and in the next!). I am sure
                 that the Lord knew we had to cross paths in each other's lives because I honestly do not know what I would be doing without you in my life.
                 Thank you for respectfully representing my culture. You are my love and light. T'z up and 679 to the world!
                </p>
